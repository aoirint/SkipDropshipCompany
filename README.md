# QuickPurchaseCompany

A Lethal Company mod that speeds up item purchases when you're on the Company or in other limited situations only.

## Features

### Instant Item Delivery

Purchased items are spawned directly on the ship.

#### When It Activates

This feature activates when any of these conditions are met:

- In orbit on the first day
- While landed on the Company
- In orbit on the next day after landing on the Company, still routing to the Company (current session only)
