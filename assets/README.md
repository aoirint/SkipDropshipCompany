# SkipDropshipCompany

A Lethal Company mod that skip the dropship when you're on the Company or in other limited situations.

## What it does

- Direct Ship Delivery: Purchased items are delivered directly to your ship instead of being delivered by dropship.

## When it activates

Direct ship delivery feature activates when any of these conditions are met:

- In orbit on the first day
- While landed on the Company
- In orbit on the next day after landing on the Company, still routing to the Company (in the same session only)

## Who needs to install

Host only. Clients do not need to install this mod, but it's safe to install on clients as it will have no effect.

If clients (including non-modded) purchase items, the direct ship delivery feature will also work for them.
